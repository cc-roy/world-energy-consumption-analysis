# world-energy-consumption-analysis

<b>Data ethics and bias considerations:</b>

The primary dataset leveraged for this project is sourced from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pralabhpoudel/world-energy-consumption. The data is derived from multiple sources, and the dataset has been updated as new data has become available. In an attempt to have a tenable scope for the project and avoid bias as much as possible, we decided to limit our analysis to the world's 25 most populous countires based on information available from: https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/. The population data is an aggregation based on information collected by the U.N., which is publicly available at: https://population.un.org/wpp/. The types of energy a country consumed, in what year consumption of that energy began, annual gross domestic product, and geographic location had no bearing on the determination of a coutry's inclusion in the project. Further, from a data ethics standpoint, the World Energy Consumption dataset was selected because it is comprised of publicly available data, and the code used to ingest + process the data is provided by the authors. This combination ensures that users of the dataset have full visibility into how the data is being handled from beginning to end.
